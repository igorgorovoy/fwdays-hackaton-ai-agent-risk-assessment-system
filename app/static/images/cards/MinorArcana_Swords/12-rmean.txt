The Queen of Swords reversed indicates that currently you may be thinking more with your heart than your head. You may be very emotionally involved in a particular situation or issue but this may be distorting your perception of the situation at hand. You need to use your head a little bit more to understand what is happening and read the signals more accurately. Look at your situation objectively and think with your head and not your heart as this may give you a better picture of the situation and help you evaluate what you need to do next.  
Similarly, the reversed Queen of Swords suggests that relationships are clouding your usually clear vision. You need to refocus your goals or direction, yet you are hesitating due to a desire not to disturb the positive balance and harmony of your relationships with others. At the end of the day, you need to be more hard-edged, confident and assertive in order to be successful. Clear sight and analysis, objective weighing of options and ideas for the future, and even carefully considering but not necessarily choosing, the alternatives are essential right now.  
On the other hand, the reversed Queen of Swords can come across as cold-hearted, bitter, resentful and bitchy, particularly if she is completely devoid of any emotion or compassion for others. In her quest to get to the bottom of an issue, she puts a lot of other people off-side and loses her support base. She isolates herself from others and is seen as narrow-minded, intolerant, and mean.
