The Ace of Swords shows a hand, cloaked in white, holding an upright sword, symbolic of the mind and the intellect. At the tip of the sword is a wreath, indicating success and victory, and a crown, indicating mental clarity. However, the barren, mountainous landscape below the sword reflects the often cold nature of intellect.
