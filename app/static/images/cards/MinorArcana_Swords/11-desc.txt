The Knight of Swords shows a young man in his armour riding a powerful white horse into the midst of a battle in the distance. The white colour of the horse symbolises the purity of the intellectual energy that motivates the rider. The sky behind him is filled with storm clouds and the trees are tossed wildly by the wind. The horse’s harness is decorated with images of butterflies and birds and the knight’s cape is also decorated with birds. He charges forward with great momentum and apparently without any regard to the dangers he may encounter.
