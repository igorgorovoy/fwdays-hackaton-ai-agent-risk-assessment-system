The Four of Swords depicts the effigy of a knight lying upon a tomb. His hands are in the position of prayer and the tomb sits within a church. The stained glass behind the statue depicts a woman and child together. One sword lies beneath the knight, symbolising that there is only one key issue that is dominating your life at this time. Three further swords hang above him, pointing downwards.
