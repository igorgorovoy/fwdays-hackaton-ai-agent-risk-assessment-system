The Knight of Swords reversed indicates that you need to go it alone in order to build up valuable life experience and maturity. As you search for freedom and independence, it is likely you will make mistakes on your way due to your reckless and impatient nature but this is all part of the journey. This card can often reflect a rebellious teenager who is fighting for their own independence, and the parents who need to allow that teenager to make the mistakes and to be accountable for their actions. 
The reversed Knight of Swords can also suggest that you need to slow down otherwise you are at risk of serious burn-out and exhaustion. You want to be involved in everything but you are not succeeding at anything due to this scattered thought and energy. As such, you are spinning your wheels and accomplishing very little but growing more and more tired by the day. Take some time out so that you can first ground yourself, gather your thoughts and focus on only the top priorities.
