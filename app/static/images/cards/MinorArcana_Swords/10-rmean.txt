Reversed, the Page of Swords can suggest you are acting hastily, without thinking things through properly. You have a lot of energy behind you to get things moving but the way you are going about it is not an effective use of your energy. Tackle things one at a time, rather than trying to deal with everything at once. This will lead to more meaningful outcomes.  
The reversed Page of Swords can also be all talk and no action. You have to be very careful of making promises that you know you cannot keep, or saying things that you later regret. Before making a specific promise or commitment, ensure that you can and will deliver on it in order to maintain your integrity and reputation. Also, be wary of other people’s commitments to you and put in place measures to ensure that they will deliver on what they promise to deliver. This reversed Page can be a bit of a ‘know-it-all’ and may be trying to impress you with big stories about his past and his achievements (which you later find out are big exaggerations of the truth!). 
The Page of Swords reversed may also indicate that you are beginning to annoy others by your constant questioning and challenging of ideas. While you may simply be trying to understand a situation or a concept better, there are more constructive and non-threatening ways to go about it. Use sentences such as, “Help me understand...” Be conscious of how you may be coming across to others when you are constantly asking, “Why?” And only challenge or question those ideas that are really important to you, rather than challenging everything that is presented. 
Finally, the reversed Page of Swords suggests a fear of public speaking. You may be anxious that you do not have sufficient experience or knowledge to present on a particular topic, or you may be afraid of being the centre of attention. Know that people simply want to hear your point of view, even if it is different from others’.
