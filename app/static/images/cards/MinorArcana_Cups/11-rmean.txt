The Knight of Cups reversed allows his emotions to control his life too much. He may be moody, jealous or emotional to the point of incapacity. He may jump to conclusions before getting all the facts. If this card shows up reversed, either look at yourself and at how you are acting, or realise that the person involved may be acting from his emotions rather than from any form of logic.  
The Knight of Cups reversed indicates a situation which was initially incredibly appealing, romantic and exciting but which later turns out to be something very different, and one walks away feeling quite disappointed. It is as though you are wearing the rose-coloured glasses, or going through the honeymoon period, only to come out realising that the situation is quite different to what you thought.
