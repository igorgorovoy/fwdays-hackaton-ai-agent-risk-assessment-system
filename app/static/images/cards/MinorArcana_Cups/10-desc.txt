The Page of Cups, like the Pages in all the suits, represents some sort of beginning or renewal. The Page of Cups is dressed in a blue tunic with floral print all over it and sports a bohemian type of beret on his head with a long, flowing scarf attached to it. The young man stands alone on the seashore with a single golden cup in his hand. Surprisingly, a fish pops its head out of the cup and looks at the young man. The young man simply expects to raise his cup for a toast or a drink, and instead is confronted with the ominous appearance of a fish, which even appears to be speaking to him. The Page of Cups indicates the surprising and unexpected nature of inspiration that comes to us from the realm of the unconscious and the spirit. Inspiration is seen to be something which comes upon us most unexpectedly and often in a manner which we do not understand.
