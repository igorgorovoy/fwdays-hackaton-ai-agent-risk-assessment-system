In Nine of Cups, a portly, middle-aged man sits upon a wooden bench with his arms crossed in contentment. He is dressed smartly and wears an expression of true satisfaction on his face and his red head-dress symbolises an active mind. Behind him is a wall with nine golden cups arranged in a structured, well-organised arch. The man enjoys success both materially and spiritually and represents the fulfilment realised after the accomplishment of our deepest desires.
