The Queen of Cups is the Queen of the realm of emotions. She is a beautiful, introspective woman who sits on a throne at the edge of the sea. In her hands, she cradles a beautiful cup with handles shaped like angels. The cup is closed, an indication that the thoughts of the Queen originate from the unconscious, from the depths of her own soul. Wearing a gold crown and silver robe, she is alone, sitting and staring at this cup, which she holds before her with both hands on the base. The stone throne upon which she sits is decorated with images of sea-nymphs, fish, and scallop shells. The sea and fish are symbols of the unconscious mind and water in general represents emotion, spirit, and feeling. The cloudless bright blue sky and placid water of the sea surround her. Her feet do not touch the water; they rest comfortably on colourful rocks washed up in front of her.
