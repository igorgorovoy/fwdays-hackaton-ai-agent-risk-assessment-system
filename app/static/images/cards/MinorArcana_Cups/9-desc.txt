On the Ten of Cups we see a loving couple united by the bonds of true, everlasting love. They not only have each other but all that they wish for in life as well, represented by the two children frolicking at their side and the small but comfortable home in the distance, surrounded by trees and water. The family home symbolises stability and homely comforts, while the green garden symbolises fertility and the river symbolises a free flow of feelings. A rainbow of cups is overhead, blessing the scene. The cups symbolise an abundance of heavenly gifts and the rainbow signifies the end of hard times and is also is considered to be a highly spiritual omen in many of the worldâ€™s religions. It is a sign that the idyllic scene we see represented has been blessed from above and reinforces the idea that the achievement of perfect love is one sure way of experiencing the glory of the heavens here on earth.
