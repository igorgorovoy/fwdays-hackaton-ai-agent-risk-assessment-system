The Nine of Cups is a card of satisfaction and wishes. When reversed, it suggests that you may be disappointed that your wishes are not materialising as expected. Your expectations may be unrealistic or you may not be actively pursuing your dreams, instead hoping that they will manifest with little input or action from you. 
On a more emotional level, the Nine of Cups upright typically indicates a wonderful feeling of satisfaction you get from knowing that everything has fallen into place and you have everything you could imagine. Reversed, however, there is a sense that there is still something missing deep down, and the inner fulfilment you have been seeking is still not present. There may be disappointments due to imperfections and mistakes, smugness, overindulgence, greed, superficial or materialistic values, shallowness, gluttony, and excessive preoccupation with gratifying your own desires, often times at the expense of the needs of others.  
Physically, the reversed Nine of Cups can indicate ill-fortune due to over-indulgence in food, alcohol or drugs and the consequences that come with them. Be careful not to overdo the sensual pleasures and instead demonstrate some moderation in your indulgences. 
The reversed Nine of Cups can suggest greed and a lack of concern for other peopleâ€™s needs in favour of your own. You may have an inadequate regard of how your behaviour is impacting others, and are often found gloating or boasting about your successes while others are suffering. Be considerate, and even if you have something to rave about, think about the impact that may have on others.
