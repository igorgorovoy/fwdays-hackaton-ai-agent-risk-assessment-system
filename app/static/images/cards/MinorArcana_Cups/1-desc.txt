The Two of Cups depicts a man and a woman exchanging cups in what appears to be a wedding ceremony with the caduceus of Hermes between them. The two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade, negotiation, balance, duality (union of opposites), proper moral conduct, protection and cosmic energy. On the Two of Cups, the caduceus sends a positive message for new partnerships, and suggests that with honour, respect and balance, new relationships shall be rewarding. At the top of the caduceus is a lionâ€™s head, a symbol of passion and fire energy suggesting that there may be a lot of sexual attraction between the people, although that may or may not be allowed to express itself. The two snakes that wind up the caduceus represent dark and light and their coexistence within us.
