With the Two of Cups reversed, you may be struggling to form new partnerships and relationships due to a lack of trust or unfinished business from the past. You may also be reluctant to open yourself and expose your true feelings, resulting in disconnectedness from those around you or awkwardness. Your behaviour has become guarded and constrained. 
The Two of Cups reversed may indicate a break-up or a lack of harmony within a relationship or partnership. You may not be seeing eye-to-eye and there is tension in your relations with each other. Each partner is finding it quite hard to be truly honest with each other and therefore the flow of communication is broken. There is a lack of mutual respect and understanding. Upright, the Two of Cups is a beautiful card to have because it shows balance and emotional connection. But reversed, it suggests that you are not on an even playing field and this is a fundamental issue. It is as if your partner thinks he or she is better than you or that his or her opinion matters more than yours. 
Even if a relationship is going great guns, the reversed Two of Cups may be a sign that the relationship is more physical than heart-felt. It may be a fleeting affair rather than something more meaningful.
