On the Six of Cups, there are six cups filled with white, five-pointed flowers. A young boy seems to smell one flower, offering this filled cup to another young child. The small child symbolises the past and the taller child symbolises the future, and together they symbolise happy reunions with past friends or lovers. They share old pleasures with lots of nostalgia. In the background, there is an older figure walking away, symbolising our worries leaving us to be locked in the turret. The house symbolises comfort and security but the barren garden symbolises the lost happier times of the past. Everything is bright yellow which indicates great happiness in this overall scene.
