On the Two of Pentacles, a young man dances as he juggles his worldly concerns. The infinity sign loops around the two Pentacles suggesting that he can handle unlimited problems. In the background, two ships ride the waves easily, cruising the ups and downs of life. The man seems to have a somewhat concerned look on his face, yet he dances with apparent abandon despite the turbulence of the sea behind him.
