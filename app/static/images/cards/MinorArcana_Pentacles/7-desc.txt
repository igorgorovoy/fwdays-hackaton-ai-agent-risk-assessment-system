The Eight of Pentacles shows a young man labouring over eight coins, carefully etching out a pentacle shape into each coin. He has already successfully completed six coins, and has two more to go. It is clear that he is in the middle of a project that absorbs all his attention. He has isolated himself from others (the town in the background) in order to concentrate on the task at hand. This card reflects a time when you are focusing all of your energy on something and making sure it is as perfect as it can be. You are very engaged in what you are doing and determined to do a good job.
