The Queen of Pentacles reversed sees you becoming very consumed in your work. You may be placing your career before your family or your relationships, and this is having a detrimental impact. Of course, this may be ok on a temporary basis but you need to assess its long-term impact. To rebalance your life, you may find a release by returning to a favourite nature spot (a forest, beach or mountain) and allowing yourself to take in this fresh, natural energy.  
Similarly, the Queen of Pentacles reversed can suggest that you are feeling worried about whether you can be financially independent, while also still maintaining your family connections. You may be concerned that if you invest in your career or financial well-being, you might not have enough energy to invest in your family. Sometimes, you just cannot do everything and you will need to make some choices. 
You may also find that you become a bit of a homebody and somewhat isolated from others. If so, you need to fight this urge and keep in touch with your friends and family as they will be a great help and support to you.  
At times, the reversed Queen of Pentacles may suggest that your tendency to ‘mother’ those you care about is actually becoming more like smothering. Your intentions are good in that you love to cook, clean, nurture and care for those around you but there may be a point at which you need to let others be accountable for their own upkeep. You cannot always be the one doing the laundry or cooking the dinner. Sometimes you need to step back and let others take on the load. Similarly, you may reach a point where you are investing so much time looking after others that you find you are neglecting yourself. Again, step back and let others take on some of the household responsibilities.
