The Ace of Pentacles depicts a single hand with a pentacle coming out of the clouds, much like the Aces of the other suits. And, again like the other Aces, the landscape below the ‘hand of heaven’ represents the primary element of the suit. In the Ace of Pentacles, the landscape is a rich garden with flowers, shrubs, a flowing creek and mountains in the distance, indicating prosperity, growth and wealth.
