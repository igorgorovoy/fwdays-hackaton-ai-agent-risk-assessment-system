The Ten of Pentacles is a card of culmination and final fulfilment. The card shows an aged, wise man sitting comfortably just outside an archway leading into a town. He is surrounded by his family and his dogs and wears a rich robe decorated with images of grapevines, crescent moons, and other symbols. Behind the laughing couple under the arch, a young boy reaches playfully to pet one of the dogs. This card is a symbol of financial security, accomplishment, and comfort. The patriarch is able to rest and enjoy the fruits of his labours in retirement while he looks on at the lives of his children and grandchildren. This is a man who has accomplished a great deal during his life and is now able to rest in the satisfaction of knowing that what he has created will provide value and joy to others, even when he is gone.
