The Four of Pentacles shows a man sitting on stool, away from his home town. He tightly holds onto his pentacles or coins in a very defensive posture as though he were hoarding them for fear of loss. One pentacle is balanced on his head, one clutched between his hands, and two are securely placed underneath his feet. He is making sure that no-one touches his coins! And, he cannot go anywhere because his feet are busy holding the coins down. In other words, this man is so tied up with his possessions, that he cannot do anything else. His eyes appear darkened from hard work but his mouth betrays the hint of a smile, which comes from the self-satisfaction of his accomplishments.
