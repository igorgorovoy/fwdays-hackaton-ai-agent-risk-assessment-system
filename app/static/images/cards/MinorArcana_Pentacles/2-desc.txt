The Three of Pentacles shows a young apprentice working in a cathedral. In front of him stand two architects who are holding the plans for the cathedral. The apprentice appears to be discussing his progress so far with two architects and even though he is less experienced, the architects listen carefully as they value his opinion and his specialist knowledge. There is also an acknowledgement that this young man is an essential contributor to the completion of the cathedral and the architects want to make sure that everyone is on the same page.
