The King of Pentacles is a card of worldly success, ultimate fulfilment, material satisfaction, and high ambition. The King sits upon a throne decorated with carvings of bulls and vines and his robe is covered with embroidered grapevines rich with fruit. He appears very regal and sophisticated. At his feet and all around him are vines, flowers, and plants of all sorts, representing the highest attainment of material success. In his right hand, he holds the sceptre of his power and in his left he holds a golden coin, symbolic of his material influence. Behind him is his castle, a symbol of all he has built through his efforts and determination. This King is therefore very serious about financial security and has made the accumulation of funds his main preoccupation in life. He is very proud of his achievements and willing to show others his prized possessions.
