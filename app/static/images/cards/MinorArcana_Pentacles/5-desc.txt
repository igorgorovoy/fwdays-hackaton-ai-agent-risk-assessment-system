The Six of Pentacles shows a man dressed in a purple robe, symbolic of his wealth and status. In one hand, he holds a balanced scale, representing fairness and equality, and with the other hand, he feeds two beggars who kneel at his feet. Not only does this card reflect the state of being materially secure, it also suggests that you are able to use the abundance in your life for the benefit of others. The wealthy man shares his abundance so that stability is preserved.
