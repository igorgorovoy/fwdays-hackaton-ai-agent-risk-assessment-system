The Nine of Pentacles shows a mature woman walking in the midst of a vineyard. The vines are heavy with grapes and golden coins representing the fruitful accomplishment of all her desires. A falcon sits calmly on her left hand, symbolising her own intellectual and spiritual self-control. Far in the background is a large house, presumably belonging to the woman herself. There is a general sense of peace, satisfaction, and the fulfilment of a creative venture or personal investment in the image of the Nine of Pentacles that offers a more permanent, lasting achievement as the result of oneâ€™s own efforts.
