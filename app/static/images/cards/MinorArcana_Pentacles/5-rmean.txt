The Six of Pentacles reversed suggests a one-way street in terms of charity. You may have lent money to a friend or given someone a favour but, in this instance, do not expect the money to be repaid or the favour to be returned. Or, you may expect it to be repaid but it never is. With this in mind, be careful about who you lend your money to, especially if you yourself are in financial trouble. While a generous spirit is a wonderful quality, you need to ensure that you are able to support yourself whilst helping others. You may have a tendency to spend or give away more than you can afford to. 
Be careful with the amount of debt that you get into. It is possible with the reversed Six of Pentacles that you are getting in over your head and it will soon come back to bite you in excessive interest rates or personal threats if you are unable to pay it back in time. Be wary, too, of ‘get rich quick’ schemes that are more likely to leave you with a hole in your pocket than a pile of cash. 
The Six of Pentacles reversed sometimes reflects the selfish side of charity. In some cases, people give to others not for the benefit of the other but for the benefit of themselves. Be careful that you are not trying to prove to others that you are generous because you can give to the poor or the needy. Aim to give selflessly rather than selfishly.  
In a relationship reading, the reversed Six of Pentacles suggests that one partner is doing a lot of the taking but not a lot of the giving, thus creating an inequality in the relationship. You need to be careful that your generous spirit is not being taken advantage of and that you are not always the one making compromises for your partner’s benefit.
