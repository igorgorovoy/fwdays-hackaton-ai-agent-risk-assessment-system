The Five of Pentacles, like the fives in the other suits, portrays a situation of adversity. In this card, a destitute couple walk through the snow outside the stained glass of a brightly lit church window. The church is symbolic of providing spiritual comfort while helping those who cannot help themselves. The man uses a crutch because of his crippled leg and the woman attempts to cover herself with her threadbare shawl. Both appear to be living in poverty and with little or no possessions.
