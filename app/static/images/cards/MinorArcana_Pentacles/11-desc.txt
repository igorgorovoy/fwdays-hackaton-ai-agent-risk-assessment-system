The Knight of Pentacles, like the Knights of the other suits, represents work, effort, and the responsibility that follows upon the dreams of the Page. The Knight of Pentacles sits upon a heavy plough horse in the midst of a field. In his hands he carries a single gold coin. His eyes reflect careful thought and consideration. The Knight is engaged in the often toilsome, routine efforts required to realise the dreams of his heart. He is building the foundations to support his dreams and his goals.
