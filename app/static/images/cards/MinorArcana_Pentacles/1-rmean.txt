The stress is getting to you and you are becoming easily overwhelmed by your responsibilities. Therefore, this card encourages you to become more organised and more planned in your approach.

It is more than likely you are investing most of your time in work, neglecting your family or your partner.

In a relationship reading, the reversed Two of Pentacles advises you not to over-commit, particularly on a more physical / logistical / material plane. Do not commit to too many plans as a couple at this stage or make any financial commitments together. Watch your spending and also how you manage your time. You may find that you get caught up with work or other commitments at this time which distracts your attention from your relationship. It will all come down to where your priorities lie and whether you want to let other commitments interfere with your relationship, or vice versa.
