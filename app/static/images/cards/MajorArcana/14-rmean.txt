Temperance reversed reflects a time when something is out of balance, in conflict or excessive, and is therefore creating stress and tension in your life. Look to the other cards in the reading to understand what is out of balance or contributing to this feeling. Temperance reversed can also be a lead indicator that, were you to follow a certain path, you would create imbalance in the situation. You may be acting impatiently or refusing to take the moderate, gentle approach. Be wary of hasty action as this will only lead to further imbalance. 
Temperance reversed can suggest that you lack a long-term vision and/or purpose and, as a result, you are feeling out of balance. This is a time when you need to reflect on what changes are necessary in your life to create greater purpose and fulfilment. Return to the energy of the Death card to understand what you need to leave behind you in the past and what changes you need to embrace in the future. 
People you are dealing with are proving to be uncooperative or you may feel as though your interests are in conflict or competition with each other. Getting the ‘flow’ right between you seems an impossible feat. You are both striving to express your individuality in very different ways. There is a lot of energy around now but none of it is being used positively. Unresolved conflicts in both of you have yet to be expressed clearly, indeed you may not be conscious of them, although you are aware that something is wrong. These conflicts may manifest themselves as role reversal. In the beginning one of you was dominant, now the other seeks to take control of the union. An old fashioned argument may be necessary to clear the air and establish new ground rules.
