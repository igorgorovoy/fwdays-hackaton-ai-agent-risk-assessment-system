The King of Wands holds a blossoming wand in his hand, representing life and creativity. His throne and cape are decorated with the lion and the salamander, symbols of fire and strength. The salamanders biting their own tails represent infinity and the ongoing drive to move forward against all obstacles. His robe is bright orange like a flame, and his crown has the shape of tongues of fire.
