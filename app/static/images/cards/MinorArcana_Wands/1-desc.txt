The man in the Two of Wands is holding a small globe and stands on the roof of a castle, looking out over a vast terrain to the right and an ocean to the left. The globe in his hands represents that the world is his oyster and there is huge potential if he can expand his horizons to encompass broader life experiences. He understands his ambition and knows what must be done. He is wearing an orange tunic, which symbolises an enthusiastic approach to life, and a red hat, symbolising a passion for adventure.
