In the Four of Wands, a couple dances beneath a welcome wreath, tied between four crystal tipped wands. The canopy of flowers on the four wands is also similar to the wedding canopy or chuppah of the traditional Jewish ceremony and thus represents a time of fulfilment and satisfaction at the attainment of a goal. In the background stand another group of people, just in front of a large castle, also decorated in flowers. It appears as if a celebration is being held, perhaps as a homecoming or a celebration from within the castle.
