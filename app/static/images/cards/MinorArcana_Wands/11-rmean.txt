The Knight of Wands reversed indicates delays and frustration, getting nowhere, and feeling anger at obstacles and at being denied what you want to have. This card, in the reversed position, represents a loss of personal power or the negative use of power. It can indicate that you are trying to camouflage or compensate for your inability to control this situation. Accompanying emotions may involve a loss of self-esteem and pessimism. 
This Knight, when reversed, is impulsive, restless, impatient and lacking in foresight. He is so keen to just pursue his own interests or hurry things along that he fails to really understand whether he will be successful or what the consequences of his actions will be. If this is you, you need to be very careful of not rushing into things without thinking it through first. Even if you are starting to get frustrated with a lack of action, you need to consider the consequences before doing something. If this is someone in your life, then it is best to steer clear of them for the time being. They need to make these mistakes in their life to learn and improve, and cannot necessarily be controlled or held back at this point. 
The Knight of Wands reversed suggests that you are at risk of acting impulsively, doing or saying things that you may later regret. You want everything to be ‘fixed’ straight away and have everything working out just as it should but you do not seem to be allowing yourself the time to really think through what is best for you. Be careful, too, that you are not reacting instantly to everything that happens but that you give your circumstances some space and time before you take action. You may also find yourself feeling frustrated that there are certain factors impacting your situation that you feel you cannot control. Again, remind yourself that there WILL be things that you can control and change as you want to.
