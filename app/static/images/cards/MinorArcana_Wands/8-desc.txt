The Nine of Wands shows a weary, injured man who holds a staff as though in a posture of final defence. He has fought the battle and won. He is protected by a number of wands behind him that appear like a wall around him. He appears drained and exhausted as he leans on his wand but he is ready to go to battle again. He has the look of determination in his eye to overcome this final challenge and reach a point of accomplishment and victory. He stands up for what he believes in and holds firm in those beliefs.
