The Knight of Wands is seen riding upon his horse, which rears up in the intensity of the Knight’s quest for success. The Knight’s face bears the determination of one bound to succeed. The plumes from the Knight of Wands’ helmet and the decorative tassels hanging from his back and arms are the colour of flame and he, like the Page, wears a shirt covered with the symbol of the fiery salamander.
