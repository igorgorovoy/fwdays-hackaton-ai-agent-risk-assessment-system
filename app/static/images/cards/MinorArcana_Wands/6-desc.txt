In the Seven of Wands, a man stands on top of a hill and is challenged below by opponents that want what he has, success and status. The man appears to be in a defensive position, fiercely retaliating against those who attack him and defending his position as ‘king of the hill’. Interestingly, the man is wearing two different shoes, suggesting that he may have uneven footing or may be unclear of his own stance.
